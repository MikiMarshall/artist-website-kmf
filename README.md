# artist-website-kmf
A complete website for a local artist I designed and wrote the content.

## Description
A local painter needed a website to showcase her work, gallery showings,
awards and provide a means of taking custom art commissions online. 
She had a vague idea of what she needed, so I came up with a design,
wrote the content from interviews, and maintained the image galleries 
until she converted her site to WordPress a while later.
